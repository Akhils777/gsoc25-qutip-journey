This integration will provide a streamlined, flexible foundation that supports state-of-the-art optimization methods and improved numerical performance.\nMoreover, this work sets the stage for replacing dependencies in related projects such as qutip-qip, moving from qutip-qtrl to qutip-qoc. This transition will enable greater flexibility and the adoption of more advanced and varied optimization techniques for precise quantum circuit control and manipulation.\nObjectives\n\nIntegrate a standalone FidelityComputer system to replace legacy fidelity computation methods, improving modularity and maintainability.\n\nSupport multiple fidelity types including PSU, SU, and TRACEDIFF, and handle both state and process fidelities.\n\nAchieve compatibility with JAX to enable accelerated numerical computation and differentiation.\n\nRefactor existing optimization algorithms (e.g., GRAPE, CRAB) to utilize the new fidelity system for improved performance and flexibility.\n\nEnsure numerical consistency with the legacy fidelity module and maintain backward compatibility.\n\nActively work to resolve currently failing test cases related to state-to-state and parameterized optimizations.\n\nDocument the new fidelity system thoroughly and provide example notebooks to help users adopt the improved framework.\n\nMentors\n\nAlex Pitchford\n\nBoxi Li"

    "text": "What did I do this week?\nOver the past week, I‚Äôve been working on analyzing two open issues in the QuTiP-QOC GitHub repository, as discussed in our weekly meeting. These issues highlight important discrepancies in the behavior of optimization algorithms for open quantum systems and represent a significant opportunity to improve reliability and correctness.\n\n\nüìå Issue #47: JOPT Fails for Open-System State Transfer\nSummary:\nWhen using the JOPT algorithm to solve a simple open-system state transfer problem (qubit from ground to excited state), the optimization crashes with a ValueError related to a dimension mismatch in the Liouville representation.\nFindings: - The issue arises during the construction of the adjoint of a matrix difference in the JOPT fidelity computation. - The mismatch in shapes ((4, 1) vs (1, 4)) suggests a bug in how the density matrix difference is reshaped and handled in Liouville space. - Notably, the exact same control setup works fine with GOAT, indicating that this is a JOPT-specific bug.\nüëâ View Issue #47\n\n\n\nüìå Issue #46: GRAPE Infidelity Mismatch\nSummary:\nThe GRAPE algorithm reports a final infidelity below the target threshold (0.0008), but manual simulation using the optimized control returns a significantly worse infidelity (0.0038).\nFindings: - Manual evolution was independently verified using both exponential propagators and mesolve, and the results are consistent. - This suggests that GRAPE either overestimates fidelity internally or there‚Äôs a bug in its cost function or propagation logic. - A ~300% mismatch raises concerns about the reliability of convergence metrics, especially in open-system scenarios.\nüëâ View Issue #46\n\n\n\n\nPlan for next week?\nNext week, I‚Äôll focus on:\n\nDigging deeper into the JOPT dimension mismatch in open-system Liouville space dynamics (Issue #47) and verifying reshaping logic and adjoint consistency\nInvestigating GRAPE‚Äôs fidelity evaluation pathway (Issue #46) to locate possible discrepancies in how cost values are tracked or computed internally\nPrototyping potential fixes in a sandboxed environment without affecting core modules\nDepending on the outcome of these investigations, I plan to raise a PR addressing one or both issues if the proposed fixes prove reliable and non-breaking\n\n\n‚ÄúI‚Äôm motivated by the opportunity to resolve foundational bugs and improve reliability in QuTiP-QOC‚Äôs optimization backend ‚Äî each fix brings us closer to a more robust and trustworthy control framework.‚Äù"

    "text": "What did I do this week?\nThis week, I worked further on resolving Issue #10, which involves replacing the legacy qutip_qtrl.fid_computer with a modern and modular FidelityComputer class designed for quantum optimal control workflows.\nPreviously, I had submitted a preliminary version of this class supporting multiple fidelity types (PSU, SU, TRACEDIFF) and ensuring compatibility with JAX for automatic differentiation. However, based on further reflection, I decided to hold off on raising a pull request and instead focused on polishing the implementation.\nThe major highlight of the week was addressing the previously failing test cases for:\n\nState-to-state GRAPE optimization\nState-to-state CRAB optimization\nParameterized CRAB optimization\n\nThese failures were caused by subtle differences in fidelity expectations and numerical tolerances when switching to the new engine. I resolved them by:\n\nEnsuring consistent handling of input shapes and data types\nCarefully aligning fidelity formulae with the expected definitions in the test suite\nImproving numerical precision and tolerances where required\n\nAs a result, all tests now pass, including the edge cases that initially failed.\nBeyond that, the direction I‚Äôve been shaping for the FidelityComputer revolves around:\n\nModular structure: With clearer separation of state, process, and map fidelities in mind, the aim is to make each component independently extensible and easier to maintain.\nBatch support: Handling multiple quantum states or unitaries efficiently has been central to the design approach, and continues to shape how I think about scaling and performance.\nCleaner integration: Ensuring compatibility with GRAPE, CRAB, and other optimization methods remains a key goal ‚Äî something I‚Äôve been aligning the implementation toward as the project evolves.\n\nWhile the code is functionally complete, I plan to further refine and customize certain parts before raising the pull request.\n\n\nPlan for next week?\nNext week, I‚Äôll focus on:\n\nStudying the relevant sections from Alex‚Äôs PhD thesis ‚Äî especially Section 1.6: Quantum control function optimisation ‚Äî to deepen my understanding of GRAPE\nFinalizing and cleaning up the FidelityComputer interface\nEnhancing the code with optional input validation and diagnostics\nRaising a well-documented and review-ready pull request\n\n\nI‚Äôm excited to be moving closer to a stable and efficient fidelity framework that can serve as the backbone of QuTiP-QOC‚Äôs optimization tools."

    "text": "What did I do this week?\nThis week, I focused on immersing myself deeply into the QuTiP-QOC codebase to understand the architecture and workflows, especially around the fidelity calculation system which is critical for quantum optimal control algorithms. I carefully read through the documentation and explored the repository, including related issues and pull requests, to grasp how different modules interact.\nA major highlight was working on Issue #10, where I contributed a Pull Request to integrate a new FidelityComputer system that replaces the old qutip_qtrl.fid_computer dependency. This new system introduces support for PSU, SU, and trace difference fidelity types, adds state and process fidelity calculations, and ensures compatibility with JAX for automatic differentiation.\nWhile the PR is a work-in-progress with three failing test cases (state-to-state GRAPE and CRAB optimizations, and parameterized CRAB), the rest of the tests show numerical consistency and improved fidelity handling. This refactoring will help make the optimization algorithms more robust and maintainable.\nAdditionally, I set up my development environment, ran existing test suites, and planned how to address the failing tests in the upcoming weeks. I also connected with my mentors and the QuTiP-QOC community, which has been encouraging and insightful.\n\n\nPlan for next week?\nMy next goal is to fix the failing test cases related to state-to-state optimizations and parameterized CRAB algorithms. I will continue enhancing the fidelity module and work on expanding the test coverage to ensure the new system fully replaces the legacy one without regression.\n\nLooking forward to making steady progress and sharing updates as I dive deeper into quantum optimal control!"
